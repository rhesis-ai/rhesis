        "1. **✓ Simple Agent Testing**: Tested basic conversational capabilities\n",
        "2. **✓ Multi-Node Workflow Testing**: Verified complex reasoning and multi-step processes\n",
        "3. **✓ Restriction Testing**: Ensured agents respect boundaries and compliance requirements\n",

        "### Key Benefits of Penelope + LangGraph:\n",
        "- **Autonomous Testing**: Penelope intelligently navigates complex conversation flows\n",
        "- **Goal-Oriented**: Define high-level testing objectives rather than scripted interactions\n",
        "- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests both happy paths and edge cases automatically\n",
        "- **Detailed Insights**: Rich reporting on agent behavior and compliance\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "- Experiment with more complex LangGraph workflows\n",
        "- Test different types of restrictions and compliance requirements\n",
        "- Integrate Penelope testing into your development workflow\n",
        "- Explore the LangChain integration notebook for chain-based testing\n",
