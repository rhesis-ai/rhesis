# GitHub PR Creation Script
# This script analyzes the current branch and creates a PR with auto-generated title and description
#
# Features:
# - Detects if the current branch exists on remote
# - Detects if there are unpushed commits
# - Prompts user to push before creating PR (Option 1: Detect and Prompt)
# - Supports --force flag to skip push detection
# - Auto-generates PR title and description
