  # ── Projects ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  - name: list_projects
    method: GET
    path: /projects/
    description: >
      List projects in the current organization. Returns project names,
      descriptions, and IDs. Use skip/limit for pagination.

  - name: create_project
    method: POST
    path: /projects/
    description: >
      Create a new project to organize test suites. A project groups
      related test sets, test configurations, and test runs.

  # ── Test Sets ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  - name: list_test_sets
    method: GET
    path: /test_sets/
    description: >
      List test sets in the organization. Test sets group related tests
      that share a common behavior, category, or theme.

  - name: create_test_set_bulk
    method: POST
    path: /test_sets/bulk
    description: >
      Create a test set with its tests in a single operation. This is
      the preferred way to create test sets — always include tests.
      Body format: {"name": "...", "description": "...",
      "short_description": "...", "tests": [...]}. Each test object:
      {"prompt": {"content": "the test prompt text", "language_code":
      "en", "expected_response": "optional expected answer"}, "behavior":
      "behavior name", "category": "category name", "topic": "topic
      name"}. The behavior, category, and topic are strings (names, not
      IDs) — they are resolved or created automatically. Use
      list_behaviors, list_categories, and list_topics to discover
      existing values.

  # ── Tests ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - name: list_tests
    method: GET
    path: /tests/
    description: >
      List tests in the organization. Each test defines a prompt,
      expected response behavior, and optional metadata.

  - name: execute_tests
    method: POST
    path: /tests/execute
    description: >
      Execute tests against a configured endpoint. Sends prompts to
      the endpoint, collects responses, and evaluates results.

  # ── Test Configurations ───────────────────────────────────
  - name: list_test_configurations
    method: GET
    path: /test_configurations/
    description: >
      List test configurations. A test configuration links a test set
      to an endpoint, defining how tests should be run.

  - name: create_test_configuration
    method: POST
    path: /test_configurations/
    description: >
      Create a test configuration that links a test set to an endpoint.
      Required: endpoint_id (UUID). Optional: test_set_id, category_id,
      topic_id, prompt_id, attributes (dict).

  - name: execute_test_configuration
    method: POST
    path: /test_configurations/{test_configuration_id}/execute
    description: >
      Execute a test configuration — runs all tests in the linked test
      set against the configured endpoint.

  # ── Test Runs ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  - name: list_test_runs
    method: GET
    path: /test_runs/
    description: >
      List test runs. Each test run represents one execution of a test
      configuration, with status and timing information.

  - name: create_test_run
    method: POST
    path: /test_runs/
    description: >
      Create a new test run to track the execution of a test configuration.

  - name: get_test_run
    method: GET
    path: /test_runs/{test_run_id}
    description: >
      Get details of a specific test run including its status, timing,
      and associated test results.

  # ── Test Results ──────────────────────────────────────────
  - name: list_test_results
    method: GET
    path: /test_results/
    description: >
      List test results. Each result contains the prompt sent, the
      response received, and evaluation scores from metrics.

  - name: get_test_result
    method: GET
    path: /test_results/{test_result_id}
    description: >
      Get details of a specific test result including the prompt,
      response, metric scores, and evaluation details.

  # ── Reference Data (read-only) ────────────────────────────
  - name: list_behaviors
    method: GET
    path: /behaviors/
    description: >
      List available behaviors. Behaviors define what an endpoint should
      do (e.g., "answer questions accurately", "refuse harmful requests").

  - name: list_categories
    method: GET
    path: /categories/
    description: >
      List available categories. Categories classify tests by type
      (e.g., "functional", "safety", "robustness").

  - name: list_topics
    method: GET
    path: /topics/
    description: >
      List available topics. Topics define subject areas for tests
      (e.g., "healthcare", "finance", "general knowledge").

  - name: list_metrics
    method: GET
    path: /metrics/
    description: >
      List available metrics for evaluating test results. Metrics
      define how endpoint responses are scored (e.g., accuracy,
      safety compliance, response quality).

  - name: create_metric
    method: POST
    path: /metrics/
    description: >
      Create a new metric for evaluating test results. Required fields:
      name (string), evaluation_prompt (string), score_type (either
      "numeric" or "categorical"), and metric_scope (list containing
      "Single-Turn" and/or "Multi-Turn" — always include this).
      For numeric metrics you can set min_score, max_score, threshold,
      and threshold_operator ("=", "<", ">", "<=", ">=", "!=").
      Optional: description, evaluation_steps, reasoning, categories
      (list of strings for categorical), passing_categories.

  - name: list_endpoints
    method: GET
    path: /endpoints/
    description: >
      List configured endpoints. Endpoints are the AI systems being
      tested (chat APIs, completion APIs, etc.).
