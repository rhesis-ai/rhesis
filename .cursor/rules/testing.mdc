# Testing Rules

## SDK Tests

1. The tests are stored in <project_root>/tests/sdk directory
2. Unit tests can be run using:
```bash
cd sdk
make test
```
3. SDK integration tests can be run using
```bash
cd sdk
make test-slow
```
You can also check the logs from the backend by using:
```bash
docker logs rhesis-backend-test
```

4. Run single tests by using uv in the sdk directory:
For example:
```bash
cd sdk
uv run pytest tests/sdk/integration/test_entities.py::test_endpoint
```
