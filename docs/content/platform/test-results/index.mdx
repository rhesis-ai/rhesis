# Test Results

Dashboard for analyzing test result trends, metrics performance, and historical data with advanced filtering.

## Understanding Test Results Dashboard

The Test Results dashboard provides comprehensive analytics across all test executions. Unlike Test Runs (which show results from a single execution), this dashboard aggregates and visualizes data from multiple test runs over time.

## Filtering Results

The dashboard includes powerful filtering options to focus your analysis:

### Time Range Filters

**Quick Filters**:

- Last month
- Last 3 months
- Last 6 months
- Last year
- All time

**Custom Date Range**: Specify exact start and end dates

### Entity Filters

- **Test Set**: Filter by specific test set
- **Test Run**: Filter by specific test run execution
- **Behavior**: Filter by test behaviors
- **Category**: Filter by test categories
- **Topic**: Filter by test topics

### Active Filter Display

Applied filters show as chips below the filter bar. Click the X to remove individual filters, or "Clear All" to reset.

## Summary Statistics

At the top of the dashboard, four summary cards display the overall pass rate (color-coded green, orange, or red based on performance), total test executions, the latest test run with a link to details, and the selected time period.

**[SCREENSHOT HERE: Test Results dashboard header showing the four summary cards (Overall Pass Rate with percentage and color, Total Tests count, Latest Test Run name with link, Time Period dates) and the filter bar above with time range selector and entity filters.]**

## Chart Views

The dashboard includes three tabbed chart views:

### Overview Tab

The Overview tab shows a pie chart of pass/fail distribution for recent results and a bar chart of the last 10 test runs with stacked pass/fail breakdowns.

### Timelines Tab

The Timelines tab displays a line chart showing pass rate trends over time, plus separate timeline charts for each individual metric to identify specific problem areas.

**[SCREENSHOT HERE: Timelines tab showing the Overall Pass Rate Timeline line chart at the top with time on X-axis and percentage on Y-axis, and several metric-specific timeline charts below showing individual metric performance trends over the same period.]**

### Dimensions Tab

The Dimensions tab uses radar charts to visualize pass rates across behaviors, categories, and topics, making it easy to compare performance across multiple dimensions at once.
