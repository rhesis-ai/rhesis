# Test Generation

Generate test sets automatically using AI-powered templates or custom configurations.

## Getting Started

Generate test sets on the [Generation page](https://app.rhesis.ai/generation). Choose your test type: **multi-turn** or **single-turn** [Test Sets](/platform/test-sets). See [Tests](platform/tests) for details on the difference.

To generate a test set, you can either:
- Provide your custom configuration (such as behaviors, topics, and categories)
- Select a predefined templates (skip to [Step 2](tests-generation#step-2-review--refine))





## Step 1: Initial Setup

![Test Generation Configuration Page](/screenshots/rhesis-ai-generation-test-configuration.png)

Provide the following information to configure your test generation:

- **Project** (optional): Associate with a project
- **Sources** (optional): Add documents for context
- **Description**: What you want to test

## Step 2: Review & Refine

![Test Generation Samples Page](/screenshots/rhesis-ai-generation-test-samples.png)

Based on the test description provided or the selected template, the system generates configuration (left side) and test samples (right side):

The configurations are divided into three categories:
- **Behaviors**: The type of behavior the target system should exhibit when responding to the prompt
- **Topics**: The specific subject matter or theme for the test
- **Categories**: High-level classification for grouping tests

Use "Further refine test generation" to modify the configuration chips, which automatically generates new test samples based on your changes. Activate "Live Responses" to test samples against your endpoint in real-time.

## Step 3: Generate

- **Name** (optional): Add descriptive name for your test set to be generated
- **Size**: Choose test set size
  - Small (25-50): Quick validation
  - Medium (75-150): Standard testing (Recommended)
  - Large (200+): Production-scale

Generation takes 2-5 minutes. You'll receive a notification when ready.
