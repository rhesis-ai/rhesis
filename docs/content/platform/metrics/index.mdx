# Metrics

Define and manage evaluation criteria for testing AI responses with LLM-based grading.

## Why Metrics?

Manual evaluation of AI responses doesn't scale. Metrics automate quality assessment so you can:

- **Test at Scale**: Evaluate thousands of responses automatically
- **Maintain Consistency**: Apply the same evaluation criteria every time
- **Track Quality**: Measure performance across different dimensions (accuracy, tone, safety)
- **Catch Regressions**: Detect when AI behavior degrades
- **Compare Models**: Evaluate different models or configurations objectively

## Understanding Metrics

Metrics are evaluation criteria that assess test responses against specific quality dimensions. Each metric uses an LLM model to evaluate test outputs and return a pass/fail result with optional scoring.

### What Metrics Contain

Each metric has a name and description that identifies what it evaluates. The evaluation configuration specifies which LLM model to use for grading, along with the evaluation prompt, evaluation steps, and reasoning instructions that guide the model's assessment. The score configuration determines whether the metric uses binary scoring (simple pass/fail) or numeric scoring (a range with a threshold for passing), including min/max scores for numeric metrics and an explanation of the scoring logic. You can add tags for categorization and search, and assign metrics to behaviors to organize them into logical groups.

### Behaviors (Metric Groups)

Behaviors are organizational categories that group related metrics. For example:

- **Accuracy**: Metrics for factual correctness
- **Tone**: Metrics for appropriate communication style
- **Safety**: Metrics for harmful content detection
- **Relevance**: Metrics for on-topic responses

## Viewing Metrics

The Metrics page has two main tabs for different views:

### Metrics Directory Tab

The Directory tab shows all available metrics with powerful filtering options to help you find what you need. Search by metric name or description, filter by evaluation backend type, metric type (Grading, API Call, Custom Code, or Custom Prompt), or score type (binary or numeric). Click any metric card to view its full configuration details, assign it to a behavior, remove it from a behavior, or delete it.

### Selected Metrics Tab

The Selected Metrics tab organizes metrics by behaviors, displaying each behavior as a collapsible section with its associated metrics grouped underneath. This view makes it easy to see which metrics are assigned to each behavior category. You can add new behaviors to create additional organizational sections, edit behavior names and descriptions, delete behaviors entirely, remove specific metrics from behaviors, or click any metric to view its details.

## Creating a Metric

Create new metrics using a 3-step wizard:

### Step 1: Metric Information

**Required Fields**:

- **Name**: Metric identifier
- **Description**: What the metric evaluates

**Optional Fields**:

- **Tags**: Categorization labels

### Step 2: Evaluation Configuration

**Model Selection**:

- Choose LLM model for evaluation (dropdown of available models)

**Evaluation Prompt**:

- Instructions for the LLM on what to evaluate
- Describes the evaluation criteria

**Evaluation Steps**:

- Numbered list of steps the LLM should follow
- Add multiple steps using "+ Add Step" button
- Remove steps as needed

**Reasoning**:

- Instructions for how the LLM should explain its evaluation

### Step 3: Score Configuration & Review

**Score Type**:

- **Binary**: Simple pass/fail
- **Numeric**: Score range with threshold

**For Numeric Scores**:

- **Min Score**: Minimum possible value
- **Max Score**: Maximum possible value
- **Threshold**: Minimum score to pass

**Explanation**:

- Description of how scoring works

**Review**:

- Summary of all configured settings
- Edit previous steps if needed
- Submit to create metric

## Managing Metrics

### Viewing Metric Details

Click any metric to open its detail page, which organizes all configuration information into clear sections. The **General Section** displays the metric's name, description, and editable tags. The **Evaluation Configuration Section** shows which model is used for evaluation, along with the evaluation prompt, steps, and reasoning instructions that guide the assessment. The **Score Configuration Section** presents the score type, min/max values (for numeric metrics), the threshold for passing, and an explanation of how scoring works.

### Editing Metrics

Each section has an "Edit" button. Click it, update fields in the edit drawer, and click "Save".

### Deleting Metrics

Click "Delete Metric" on the detail page and confirm. The metric is permanently removed.

### Assigning Metrics to Behaviors

From the Metrics Directory tab, click "Assign" on a metric card, select a behavior, and the metric appears under that behavior in the Selected Metrics tab. Use the remove button to unassign metrics.

## Managing Behaviors

Create behaviors by clicking "+ Add New Section" on the Selected Metrics tab, entering a name and description, and saving. Edit or delete behaviors using the icons on each behavior section header.
