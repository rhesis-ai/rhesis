# Penelope 🦸‍♀️

**Intelligent Multi-Turn Testing Agent for AI Applications**

Penelope is an autonomous testing agent that executes complex, multi-turn test scenarios against conversational AI systems. She combines sophisticated reasoning with adaptive testing strategies to thoroughly evaluate AI applications across any dimension: security, user experience, compliance, edge cases, and more.

## What is Penelope?

Penelope automates the kind of testing that requires:

- **Multiple interactions**: Not just one-shot prompts, but extended conversations
- **Adaptive behavior**: Adjusting strategy based on responses  
- **Tool use**: Making requests, analyzing data, extracting information
- **Goal orientation**: Knowing when the test is complete
- **Resource utilization**: Leveraging context and documentation

Think of Penelope as a QA engineer who can execute test plans autonomously through conversation.

## What Makes Penelope Unique? 🦸‍♀️

Unlike traditional testing frameworks or simple prompt testing tools, Penelope brings:

- **True Multi-Turn Understanding**: Native support for stateful conversations with full context retention
- **Provider Agnostic**: Works seamlessly with OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI, and any OpenAI-compatible provider
- **Target Flexible**: Test Rhesis endpoints, LangChain apps, CrewAI agents, or any conversational system
- **Smart Defaults**: Specify just a goal, and Penelope plans the testing approach herself
- **LLM-Driven Evaluation**: Goal achievement is evaluated by LLMs, not brittle heuristics
- **Transparent Reasoning**: See Penelope's thought process at each step
- **Prompt Engineering Built-In**: Sophisticated Jinja2 template system for customization
- **Type-Safe Throughout**: Full Pydantic validation from config to results

## Design Philosophy

Penelope is built following [Anthropic's agent engineering principles](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents):

1. **Simplicity**: Single-purpose agent with clear responsibilities
2. **Transparency**: Explicit reasoning at each step
3. **Quality ACI**: Extensively documented tools with clear usage patterns
4. **Ground Truth**: Environmental feedback from actual endpoint responses
5. **Stopping Conditions**: Clear termination criteria
