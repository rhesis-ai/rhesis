# Dashboard

The dashboard provides a centralized view of your test activity, performance trends, and quality metrics.

At a glance, you can see pass rates, execution volume, active and recent runs, and top failure areas. Interactive charts and filters let you drill down by project, test set, date range, or behavior, while timelines and histories keep you informed about ongoing and past activity.
