# MCP

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers allow you to export sources from external tools into your Rhesis Knowledge base.
These sources can then be used in test generation and other workflows.

## Setting Up an MCP Connection

### Quick Setup Video

Watch this video to see how to connect your Notion workspace and export pages as knowledge sources:

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0, overflow: "hidden", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7OI7RQSKvkc"
    style={{ position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }}
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>



### Notion Setup

1. Create a Notion integration at [https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations). In the "Access" section, grant permissions to the pages and databases you want to export.
2. Copy the integration token (begins with `ntn_`)
3. In Rhesis, navigate to the MCP page and click "Add MCP Server"
4. Select "Notion" as the provider type
5. Enter a connection name and paste the token
6. Test the connection
7. Save

### Custom MCP Servers

1. Select "Custom" as the provider type
2. Enter a connection name
3. Provide the full MCP server configuration as JSON in tool metadata
4. Include required authentication tokens in credentials
5. Test the connection
6. Save

**Note**: Custom MCP server support may not be fully functional in all cases.
