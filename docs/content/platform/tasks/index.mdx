# Tasks

Track, manage, and collaborate on test-related work items and follow-ups.

## Understanding Tasks

Tasks are work items created to address test failures, follow up on issues, or track improvements. They provide a lightweight project management layer integrated with your testing workflow.

## Task Types

### Test Failure Tasks

Automatically or manually created when tests fail:

- Linked to specific test results
- Include failure details and context
- Track resolution progress

### Improvement Tasks

Track enhancements and optimizations:

- New test coverage areas
- Metric refinements
- Performance improvements

### Review Tasks

Collaborative review items:

- Test set validation
- Behavior definition reviews
- Metric threshold adjustments

## Creating Tasks

### Manual Creation

Create tasks directly:

1. Navigate to the Tasks page
2. Click "Create Task"
3. Enter task details:
   - **Title**: Brief description
   - **Description**: Detailed information
   - **Priority**: High, Medium, or Low
   - **Assignee**: Team member responsible
   - **Due Date**: Target completion date
   - **Related Test/Test Set**: Link to relevant tests
4. Save the task

### Automatic Creation

Tasks can be automatically created:

- When tests fail multiple times
- Based on configured rules and thresholds
- Through integrations (e.g., from test runs)

## Managing Tasks

### Task States

Tasks progress through states:

- **Open**: Newly created, not yet started
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Blocked**: Waiting on dependencies
- **Resolved**: Completed successfully
- **Closed**: Verified and finalized
