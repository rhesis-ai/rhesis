# Quick Start

Get started with Penelope in minutes. This guide shows you how to run your first multi-turn test.

## Simple Test (Goal Only)

For straightforward tests, just specify the goal and Penelope will plan its own approach:

```python
from rhesis.penelope import PenelopeAgent, EndpointTarget

# Initialize Penelope with defaults (Vertex AI / gemini-2.0-flash-exp, 10 max iterations)
agent = PenelopeAgent()

# Create target - loads endpoint configuration from Rhesis platform
target = EndpointTarget(endpoint_id="my-chatbot-prod")

# Execute a simple test - Penelope plans its own approach
result = agent.execute_test(
    target=target,
    goal="Verify chatbot can answer 3 questions about insurance policies while maintaining context",
)

print(f"Goal achieved: {result.goal_achieved}")
print(f"Turns used: {result.turns_used}")
```

## Detailed Test (Goal + Instructions)

For complex tests, provide specific instructions and optional scenario for testing methodology:

```python
# Execute a detailed test with specific testing strategy
result = agent.execute_test(
    target=target,
    goal="""
    The chatbot should:
    1. Answer the initial question correctly
    2. Maintain context across 3+ follow-up questions
    3. Provide consistent information throughout
    4. Handle clarifications naturally
    """,
    instructions="""
    Test the chatbot's ability to handle insurance policy questions:
    1. Start with a basic coverage question
    2. Ask follow-ups that reference previous answers (use pronouns like "it", "that")
    3. Request clarification on specific points
    4. Verify consistency across all answers
    """,
    scenario="You are a confused customer trying to understand your insurance coverage",
    context={
        "policy_info": "Standard policy covers medical, surgical, and preventive care",
        "expected_behavior": "Professional, helpful tone",
    }
)

# Check results
print(f"Goal achieved: {result.goal_achieved}")
print(f"Turns used: {result.turns_used}")
print(f"Findings: {result.findings}")

# Access full conversation history
for turn in result.history:
    print(f"Turn {turn.turn_number}: {turn.reasoning}")
```

## When to Use Each Approach

<Callout type="info">
  **Use goal-only (simple)** for:
  - Straightforward capability tests
  - Exploratory testing
  - Basic conversation quality checks

**Use goal + instructions (detailed)** for:

- Security testing with specific attack patterns
- Compliance verification with exact steps
- A/B testing different approaches to same goal
- Complex multi-phase testing scenarios

</Callout>

## Custom Model Configuration

Penelope uses Vertex AI with Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental by default. You can customize the model:

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import AnthropicLLM
from rhesis.penelope import PenelopeAgent

# Use a specific model
agent = PenelopeAgent(
    model=AnthropicLLM(model_name="claude-4"),
    max_iterations=20,
)
```

Or set defaults:

```python
from rhesis.penelope import PenelopeConfig

# Set default for all future agents
PenelopeConfig.set_default_model("anthropic", "claude-4")
PenelopeConfig.set_default_max_iterations(20)

# Now all agents without explicit config use these defaults
agent = PenelopeAgent()  # Uses anthropic/claude-4 with 20 max iterations
```

## Understanding Test Results

The `TestResult` object provides comprehensive information:

```python
result = agent.execute_test(...)

# Status information
print(f"Status: {result.status}")
print(f"Goal achieved: {result.goal_achieved}")
print(f"Turns used: {result.turns_used}")
print(f"Duration: {result.duration_seconds}s")

# Key findings
for finding in result.findings:
    print(f"- {finding}")

# Full conversation history
for turn in result.history:
    print(f"\nTurn {turn.turn_number}:")
    print(f"  Reasoning: {turn.reasoning}")
    print(f"  Action: {turn.action}")
    print(f"  Result: {turn.action_output}")
```
