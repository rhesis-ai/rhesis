# Models

Models are core components of the SDK that enable you to create and manage test sets for Gen AI applications. Models also play a crucial role in the evaluation process, serving as LLM judges to assess and validate outputs.

### Using the `get_model` function

The easiest way to use models is through the `get_model` function. When called without any arguments, this function returns the default Rhesis model.

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import get_model

model = get_model()
```

To use a different provider, you can pass the provider name as an argument. This will use the default model for that provider.

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import get_model

# Use default Gemini model
model = get_model("gemini")
```

**Supported providers:**

- `gemini` - Google's AI models with multimodal support
- `openai` - OpenAI models including GPT-4
- `huggingface` - Open-source models from Hugging Face
- `ollama` - Local model execution using Ollama
- `rhesis` - Models served by Rhesis

To use a specific model, provide its name in the format `provider/model_name`:

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import get_model

model = get_model("gemini/gemini-2.0-flash")
```

The above code is equivalent to:

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import get_model

model = get_model(provider="gemini", model_name="gemini-2.0-flash")
```

### Direct import

Alternatively, you can access models by importing the model class directly. When you provide a model name as an argument, that specific model will be used. If no model name is provided, the default model for that provider will be used.

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import GeminiLLM, OllamaLLM

# Use default Ollama model
ollama_model = OllamaLLM()

# Use specific Gemini model
gemini_model = GeminiLLM('gemini-2.0-flash')
```

### Generate content with models

All models share a consistent interface. The primary function is `generate`, which accepts:

- `prompt`: The text prompt for generation
- `schema`: (optional) A Pydantic schema defining the structure of the generated text

**Generate text using prompt only:**

```python
# Use default Rhesis model
model = get_model()
output = model.generate(prompt="What is the capital of France?")
# Output: "The capital of France is Paris."
```

**Generate structured output using schemas:**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from rhesis.sdk.models import get_model

class City(BaseModel):
    name: str
    population: int

class CityResponse(BaseModel):
    biggest_cities: list[City]

# Use default Rhesis model
model = get_model()
output = model.generate(
    prompt="The list of 5 biggest cities in Germany?",
    schema=CityResponse
)
```

### Using models with synthesizers and metrics

Models become most useful when combined with synthesizers and metrics:

```python
from rhesis.sdk.models import get_model
from rhesis.sdk.synthesizers import PromptSynthesizer
from rhesis.sdk.metrics import RhesisPromptMetricNumeric

# With synthesizers
model = get_model("gemini")
synthesizer = PromptSynthesizer(
    prompt="Generate tests for the car selling chatbot",
    model=model
)

# With metrics
metric = RhesisPromptMetricNumeric(
    name="answer_quality_evaluator",
    evaluation_prompt="Evaluate the answer for accuracy, completeness, clarity, and relevance.",
    model="gemini"
)
```
