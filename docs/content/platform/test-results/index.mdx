# Test Results

Dashboard for analyzing test result trends, metrics performance, and historical data with advanced filtering.

## Understanding Test Results Dashboard

The Test Results dashboard provides comprehensive analytics across all test executions. Unlike Test Runs (which show results from a single execution), this dashboard aggregates and visualizes data from multiple test runs over time.

## Filtering Results

The dashboard includes powerful filtering options to focus your analysis:

### Time Range Filters

**Quick Filters**:

- Last month
- Last 3 months
- Last 6 months
- Last year
- All time

**Custom Date Range**: Specify exact start and end dates

### Entity Filters

- **Test Set**: Filter by specific test set
- **Test Run**: Filter by specific test run execution
- **Behavior**: Filter by test behaviors
- **Category**: Filter by test categories
- **Topic**: Filter by test topics

### Active Filter Display

Applied filters show as chips below the filter bar. Click the X to remove individual filters, or "Clear All" to reset.

## Summary Statistics

At the top of the dashboard, four summary cards display the overall pass rate (color-coded green, orange, or red based on performance), total test executions, the latest test run with a link to details, and the selected time period.

## Chart Views

The dashboard includes three tabbed chart views:

### Overview Tab

The Overview tab shows a pie chart of pass/fail distribution for recent results and a bar chart of the last 10 test runs with stacked pass/fail breakdowns.

### Timelines Tab

The Timelines tab displays a line chart showing pass rate trends over time, plus separate timeline charts for each individual metric to identify specific problem areas.

### Dimensions Tab

The Dimensions tab uses radar charts to visualize pass rates across behaviors, categories, and topics, making it easy to compare performance across multiple dimensions at once.
