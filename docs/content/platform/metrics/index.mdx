# Metrics

Define and manage evaluation criteria for testing AI responses with LLM-based grading.

<Callout type="default">
  **What are Metrics?** Metrics are quantifiable measurements that evaluate AI behavior and determine if requirements are met.
</Callout>

## Metrics at a glance

Metrics are organized by [**Behaviors**](/platform/behaviors), which define how your AI system should perform. Each behavior represents a specific aspect of your system's output that you want to evaluate.

**In short:** Behaviors define what you expect, metrics measure how well you meet those expectations.

You can add an existing metric to a behavior by clicking the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the chip on the Metrics Overview page.

## Using Existing Metrics

The platform includes pre-built metrics from multiple providers:

- **[DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)** - The LLM Evaluation Framework by Confident AI
- **[Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)** - Supercharge Your LLM Application Evaluations by Exploding Gradients
- **Rhesis** - Custom metrics developed by the Rhesis team

Here are some examples:

| Metric Name | Provider | Score Type | Scope | Description |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------|-------------|
| Role Adherence | DeepEval | Numeric | Multi-Turn | Evaluates whether the assistant maintains its assigned role throughout the conversation. |
| Knowledge Retention | Rhesis | Numeric | Multi-Turn | Measures memory consistency and correct use of information introduced earlier in the conversation. |
| Answer Accuracy | Ragas | Numeric | Single-Turn | Measures accuracy of the generated answer against ground truth. |


## Creating Custom Metrics

You can create custom metrics tailored to your specific evaluation needs. Here's what you'll need to configure:

### 1. Evaluation Process

Define how the LLM evaluates responses by providing three key components:

<details>
<summary><strong>Evaluation Prompt</strong></summary>

Write clear instructions specifying what to evaluate and the criteria to use.

```
Example: "Evaluate whether the response is accurate, complete, and relevant.
Use the following criteria: accuracy of facts, coverage of required points,
clarity of explanation."
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Evaluation Steps</strong></summary>

Break down the evaluation into clear steps. These guide the LLM when producing a score and reasoning.

```
Example:
1. Check Accuracy: Identify any factual errors or unsupported statements
2. Check Coverage: Determine if all required elements are addressed
3. Check Clarity: Assess whether the response is clear and well-structured
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Reasoning Instructions</strong></summary>

Explain how to reason about the evaluation and weight different aspects.

```
Example: "Extract key claims, assess completeness and correctness,
weigh issues by importance, then determine the final score."
```
</details>

**Best Practices:**
- Focus on one evaluation dimension (accuracy, tone, safety, etc.)
- Use concrete, measurable criteria
- Provide clear examples when possible

### 2. Score Configuration

Choose your scoring approach:

<details>
<summary><strong>Numeric Scoring</strong></summary>

Define a numeric scale with a pass/fail threshold:

- **Min/Max Score**: e.g., 0-10
- **Threshold**: Passing score (e.g., 7)
- **Operator**: `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, or `=`

*Example: Min 0, Max 10, Threshold ≥7 means scores 7-10 pass, 0-6 fail.*

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Categorical Scoring</strong></summary>

Define custom categories for classification:

- Add categories: "Excellent", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"
- Use comma or Enter to add each category
- The LLM classifies responses into one category

*Example: "Safe", "Borderline", "Unsafe" for safety evaluation.*

</details>

---

### 3. Metric Scope

Select applicable test types (at least one required):

- **Single-Turn**: Individual question-answer pairs
- **Multi-Turn**: Multi-exchange conversations

You can find more information about test types in the [Tests Section](/platform/tests).

---

### 4. Result Explanation

Provide instructions for how the LLM should explain its scoring rationale.

```
Example: "Explain which specific parts were accurate or inaccurate,
citing evidence from the provided context."
```
