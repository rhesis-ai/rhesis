# LLM Providers

Connect to AI service providers to power your metric evaluation and testing workflows.

## Understanding LLM Providers

LLM Providers are connections to AI models used for evaluating test responses. Each provider connection includes a connection name that identifies the specific configuration, the provider (AI service like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google), the specific model name to use, the provider's API endpoint URL, your API key for authentication, and optional custom HTTP headers if needed.

## Supported Providers

Rhesis supports connections to major AI providers including: Anthropic (Claude), Cohere, Google (Gemini, PaLM), Groq, Hugging Face, Meta (Llama), Mistral, Ollama (local models), OpenAI (GPT), Perplexity, Replicate, Together AI, and Custom (vLLM) for self-hosted models.

## Connecting a Provider

### Standard Provider Connection

1. Click "Add LLM" card on the LLM Providers page
2. Select a provider from the list
3. Fill in the connection details:
   - **Connection Name**: Unique identifier for this connection
   - **Model Name**: Specific model (e.g., "gpt-4", "claude-3-opus")
   - **API Endpoint**: Provider's API URL
   - **API Key**: Your API key from the model provider's dashboard
4. (Optional) Add custom headers if required
5. Click "Connect"

### Custom Provider (vLLM) Connection

For self-hosted or custom model deployments:

1. Select "vLLM" as the provider
2. Provide additional details:
   - **Provider Name**: Descriptive name for your deployment
   - **Model Name**: Your model identifier
   - **API Endpoint**: Full URL of your deployment
   - **API Key**: Authentication key (if required)
3. Configure custom headers as needed
4. Click "Connect"

## Managing Provider Connections

### Viewing Connections

Connected providers display:

- Provider icon with checkmark
- Connection name and description
- Model being used
- Masked API key (last 4 characters visible)
- "Connected" status button

### Adding Custom Headers

Custom headers can be added during setup:

1. In the connection dialog, scroll to "Custom Headers" section
2. Enter header name and value
3. Click "Add" button
4. Headers appear in the list
5. Remove headers using the delete icon

**Note**: Authorization header is automatically included with your API key.

### Deleting Connections

Remove a provider connection:

1. Click delete icon (X) on the provider card
2. Confirm deletion in the dialog
3. Connection is permanently removed

**Warning**: Metrics using this provider will no longer work after deletion.

## Using Provider Connections

Once connected, providers are available for:

- **Metric Evaluation**: Select the model when creating metrics
- **Test Execution**: Metrics use the configured provider to evaluate test responses

The system automatically handles:

- Authentication with your API key
- Request formatting for the provider
- Response parsing and error handling
