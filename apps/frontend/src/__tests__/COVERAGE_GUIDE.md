# Coverage Reports Guide

## What Are Coverage HTML Files?

The HTML files in `coverage/lcov-report/` are **detailed code coverage reports** generated by Jest. They show:

- **Which lines of code** are covered by tests (green)
- **Which lines are missed** by tests (red)
- **Branch coverage** (if/else conditions)
- **Function coverage** (which functions are tested)

## How to View Coverage Reports

### After Running Coverage Tests

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### View the Report

1. Open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in your browser
2. Navigate through the file tree to see detailed coverage for each file
3. Click on any file to see which lines are covered (green) vs uncovered (red)

## What to Do with Coverage Reports

### ‚úÖ Keep These Files

- Generated during CI/CD for tracking coverage trends
- Useful for identifying untested code paths
- Help guide where to write additional tests

### üóëÔ∏è Clean Up Instructions

```bash
# Clean coverage files after reviewing
npm run test:clean-coverage

# Or manually remove
rm -rf coverage/
```

The coverage directory is automatically ignored by git (see `.gitignore`).

## Coverage Targets

Currently configured thresholds:

- **Statements**: 70%
- **Branches**: 70%
- **Functions**: 70%
- **Lines**: 70%

These will be enforced in CI/CD to maintain code quality.

## Using Coverage Reports Effectively

1. **Run coverage**: `npm run test:coverage`
2. **Review the report**: Look for red-highlighted areas (untested code)
3. **Write missing tests**: Focus on uncovered business logic, not just utilities
4. **Clean up**: Remove coverage directory when done reviewing

The reports are designed to be temporary artifacts for analysis, not permanent documentation.
