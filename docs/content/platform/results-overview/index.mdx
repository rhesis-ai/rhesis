# Results Overview

Monitor and analyze test execution results across your organization.

## Understanding Results

The Results Overview provides a centralized view of all test execution activity, performance trends, and quality metrics across your projects and test sets.

### Dashboard Tour

Watch this video to see the modernized Rhesis dashboard in action. Get instant insights into your test performance and team activity without jumping between multiple screens:

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0, overflow: "hidden", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
  <iframe

</div>

**Dashboard Features:**
- Key metrics at a glance with interactive charts
- Real-time pass rate trends with history
- Recent test runs with instant status indicators
- Team activity timeline showing all project changes

The dashboard provides clear visibility into quality trends, test performance, and team collaboration across your LLM and agentic applications.

## Dashboard Components

### Execution Summary

High-level metrics showing:

- Overall pass rate percentage
- Active test runs in progress
- Recent failure trends

### Test Run History

Chronological view of recent test executions:

- Test set name and description
- Execution timestamp
- Pass/fail counts
- Duration
- Triggered by (user or automation)

### Performance Trends

- **Tags**: Filter by test or test set tags

## Analyzing Trends

### Time-Based Analysis

Track performance over time:

- Compare current vs. previous periods
- Identify degradation patterns
- Monitor improvement after fixes
- Spot seasonal or usage patterns

### Behavioral Analysis

Understand performance by behavior:

- Which behaviors consistently pass
- Where the system struggles
- Correlation between behaviors
- Impact of changes on specific behaviors
