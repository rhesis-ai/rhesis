- **Real-World Example**: See how Rhesis handles domain-specific AI interactions
- **Quick Proof-of-Concept**: Test platform functionality before committing to custom configuration
- **Learning Resource**: Understand best practices through a working implementation

## API Endpoints

The chatbot service provides several endpoints for interaction and monitoring:

### Chat Endpoint

**POST** `/chat`

The primary interaction endpoint for conversing with Rosalind.

<CodeBlock filename="chat-request.json" language="json">
  {`{
  "message": "What is the difference between term life and whole life insurance?",
  "session_id": "optional-session-id",
  "use_case": "insurance"
}`}
</CodeBlock>

**Response:**

<CodeBlock filename="chat-response.json" language="json">
  {`{
  "message": "Great question! Term life insurance covers you for a specific period (like 10, 20, or 30 years) and pays out only if you pass away during that term. It's typically more affordable. Whole life insurance, on the other hand, covers you for your entire life and includes a savings component that builds cash value over time. It's more expensive but offers lifelong protection and a savings element.",
  "session_id": "abc123-def456-ghi789",
  "context": [
    "Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific time period",
    "Whole life insurance offers permanent coverage with cash value",
    "Term policies are generally more affordable than whole life"
  ],
  "use_case": "insurance"
}`}
</CodeBlock>

**Parameters:**

- `message` (string, required): Your question or message to Rosalind
- `session_id` (string, optional): UUID for conversation continuity. If omitted, a new session is created
- `use_case` (string, optional): The domain context. Defaults to "insurance"

### Health Check Endpoint

**GET** `/health`

Monitor service availability and status.

<CodeBlock filename="health-response.json" language="json">
  {`{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "rhesis-insurance-chatbot",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}`}
</CodeBlock>

### API Information Endpoint

**GET** `/`

Get information about available endpoints and rate limits.

<CodeBlock filename="api-info-response.json" language="json">
  {`{
  "service": "Rhesis Insurance Chatbot API",
  "description": "Chat with Rosalind, your insurance expert",
  "endpoints": {
    "chat": "/chat (POST)",
    "health": "/health (GET)",
    "use_cases": "/use-cases (GET)",
    "sessions": "/sessions/{session_id} (GET, DELETE)"
  },
  "rate_limits": {
    "authenticated": "100 requests/hour",
    "unauthenticated": "20 requests/hour"
  }
}`}
</CodeBlock>

### Session Management

**GET** `/sessions/{session_id}`

Retrieve conversation history for a specific session.

<CodeBlock filename="session-response.json" language="json">
  {`{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is term life insurance?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Term life insurance is a type of life insurance..."
    }
  ]
}`}
</CodeBlock>

**DELETE** `/sessions/{session_id}`

Delete a conversation session and its history.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and service stability, the chatbot implements rate limiting:

### Unauthenticated Users

- **20 requests per hour** per IP address
- Ideal for quick demos and initial exploration
- Rate limit resets every hour

### Authenticated Users

- **100 requests per hour** per user account
- Higher limits for logged-in users
- Suitable for extended testing and evaluation

### Rate Limit Headers

All responses include rate limit information in headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed in the time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests remaining
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Timestamp when the rate limit resets

When rate limits are exceeded, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status code with a `Retry-After` header indicating when to retry.

## Example Usage

### Python Example

<CodeBlock
  filename="chatbot_example.py"
  language="python"
>
{`import requests

# Base URL for the chatbot service

BASE_URL = "https://chatbot.rhesis.ai" # Replace with actual URL

def chat_with_rosalind(message, session_id=None):
"""Send a message to Rosalind and get a response."""

    payload = {
        "message": message,
        "use_case": "insurance"
    }

    if session_id:
        payload["session_id"] = session_id

    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/chat",
        json=payload,
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    )

    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        print(f"Rosalind: {data['message']}")
        print(f"Session ID: {data['session_id']}")
        return data
    elif response.status_code == 429:
        print("Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before trying again.")
        return None
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
        return None

# Example conversation

response1 = chat_with_rosalind(
"What types of insurance do I need as a homeowner?"
)

if response1: # Continue the conversation using the same session
response2 = chat_with_rosalind(
"How much coverage should I have?",
session_id=response1["session_id"]
)`}

</CodeBlock>

### JavaScript Example

<CodeBlock
  filename="chatbot_example.js"
  language="javascript"
>
{`const BASE_URL = "https://chatbot.rhesis.ai";  // Replace with actual URL

async function chatWithRosalind(message, sessionId = null) {
const payload = {
message: message,
use_case: "insurance"
};

if (sessionId) {
payload.session_id = sessionId;
}

try {
const response = await fetch(\`\${BASE_URL}/chat\`, {
method: "POST",
headers: {
"Content-Type": "application/json"
},
body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});

    if (response.status === 200) {
      const data = await response.json();
      console.log(\`Rosalind: \${data.message}\`);
      console.log(\`Session ID: \${data.session_id}\`);
      return data;
    } else if (response.status === 429) {
      console.log("Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before trying again.");
      return null;
    } else {
      console.error(\`Error: \${response.status}\`);
      return null;
    }

} catch (error) {
console.error("Request failed:", error);
return null;
}
}

// Example usage
(async () => {
const response1 = await chatWithRosalind(
"What is the difference between HMO and PPO health insurance?"
);

if (response1) {
// Continue the conversation
const response2 = await chatWithRosalind(
"Which one is typically more expensive?",
response1.session_id
);
}
})();`}

## Best Practices

### Session Management

- **Reuse session IDs** for multi-turn conversations to maintain context
- **Store session IDs** on the client side for conversation continuity
- **Delete sessions** when conversations end to keep memory usage optimal

### Error Handling

- **Handle rate limits gracefully** by implementing exponential backoff
- **Check response status codes** before parsing JSON
- **Display user-friendly messages** when errors occur

### Performance

- **Keep messages concise** for faster responses (under 500 words recommended)
- **Avoid rapid-fire requests** to prevent rate limiting
- **Cache session IDs** instead of creating new sessions for each message

## Limitations

<Callout type="warning">
  The default insurance chatbot is designed for evaluation and onboarding
  purposes. Please note the following limitations:
</Callout>

- **Domain-Specific**: Rosalind is trained for insurance questions only and may decline off-topic queries
- **Rate Limited**: Usage is restricted to prevent abuse and ensure availability
- **No Persistence**: Session data is stored in memory and may be cleared during deployments
- **No SLA**: This is a demo service without uptime guarantees
- **English Only**: Currently supports English language interactions only

## Moving to Production

Once you've explored Rosalind and understand the platform, you'll want to create your own custom endpoints:

1. **Configure Your Own Endpoint**: Set up endpoints pointing to your AI services
2. **Integrate Your API Keys**: Use your own LLM provider credentials
3. **Customize System Prompts**: Tailor the AI behavior to your specific use case
4. **Set Up Testing**: Create test sets to validate your endpoint performance
5. **Monitor Metrics**: Track quality, latency, and other key performance indicators

Learn more about creating custom endpoints in the [Endpoints documentation](/docs/platform/endpoints).

## Troubleshooting

### 429 Rate Limit Exceeded

**Problem**: Receiving "429 Too Many Requests" responses.

**Solution**: Wait for the rate limit window to reset (shown in `Retry-After` header) or sign in for higher limits.

### Session Not Found

**Problem**: GET `/sessions/{session_id}` returns 404.

**Solution**: The session may have expired or been cleared. Start a new conversation without a session_id.

### Slow Response Times

**Problem**: Chat responses take longer than expected.

**Solution**: This is a shared demo service. For production use cases with guaranteed performance, configure your own endpoints.

### Off-Topic Responses

**Problem**: Rosalind declines to answer your question.

**Solution**: Ensure your question is related to insurance. For other domains, configure custom endpoints with appropriate system prompts.
