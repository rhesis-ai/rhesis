# 🚀 Contributing to Rhesis Backend

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Rhesis backend! 🎉 This document provides comprehensive guidelines and instructions for contributing to our project.

## 🐍 Python Version Requirements

The Rhesis backend requires **Python 3.10** or newer. If you encounter issues with your system's Python version, we recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage Python versions.

### 🍎 macOS Installation

**Prerequisites**: Ensure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and Xcode Command Line Tools installed.

```bash
# Install pyenv via Homebrew
brew install pyenv

# Install required dependency
brew install xz

# Configure your shell (choose one based on your shell)
# For zsh (default on macOS Catalina+):
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zprofile
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zprofile
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zprofile

# For bash:
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile

# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.zprofile  # or source ~/.bash_profile for bash

# Install Python 3.10
pyenv install 3.10.17

# Set global or local Python version
pyenv global 3.10.17  # Sets as default for all projects
# OR
pyenv local 3.10.17   # Sets for current directory only

# Verify installation
python --version

# Create a fresh virtual environment with UV
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 🐧 Linux Installation

```bash
# Install pyenv
curl https://pyenv.run | bash

# Install build dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python-openssl

# Add pyenv to your shell (the installer usually does this automatically)
# If needed, add these lines to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
# export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
# [[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
# eval "$(pyenv init -)"

# Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc

# Install Python 3.10
pyenv install 3.10.17

# Set local Python version
pyenv local 3.10.17

# Create a fresh virtual environment with UV
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Important Notes:**
- **macOS users**: If you encounter permission issues, you may need to run `xcode-select --install` to ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are properly installed
- **Shell configuration**: Changes to shell configuration files won't take effect until you restart your terminal or run the `source` command
- **Verification**: Always verify your Python version with `python --version` after installation

This ensures you're using a clean Python environment without potential conflicts from other packages or Python installations.

## ⚡ Development Setup

1. 📥 **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhesis-ai/rhesis.git
cd rhesis
```

2. 🛠️ **Install GitHub CLI** (required for automated PR creation):
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh

# macOS
brew install gh

# Or download from: https://cli.github.com/
```

3. 🔐 **Authenticate with GitHub**:
```bash
gh auth login
```

4. 📦 **Set up the backend environment and dependencies**:

   **⚠️ Important**: You must create and activate a Python virtual environment before installing dependencies.

   ```bash
   cd apps/backend
   
   # Create a fresh virtual environment with UV
   uv venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   uv pip install hatch
   uv sync --extra dev
   uv pip install -e .
   uv pip install -e ../../sdk
   ```
   This will:
   - Create a clean Python virtual environment for the backend
   - Sync all dependencies, including development dependencies (such as Sphinx for docs)
   - Install the backend package in editable mode
   - Install the Rhesis SDK package (required for backend operation)

## ☁️ Cloud Database Setup (Currently Required for Backend)

**⚠️ Important**: The Cloud Database Setup is **currently required** before running the backend server. The backend cannot start without a properly configured database connection.

**🔮 Future Development**: This is a temporary requirement while the project uses a shared cloud database. In the future, developers will be able to run their own local database, making this setup optional.

**🖥️ Platform Support**: The automated database proxy service setup is **Linux-only**. macOS users can use the manual `db-proxy.sh` method described below, or alternative connection methods if needed.

### Prerequisites

1. **Google Cloud CLI**: Install the [gcloud CLI tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
2. **Project Access**: Ensure you have access to the Google Cloud project and appropriate permissions

### Obtaining Credentials

1. **Authenticate with Google Cloud**:
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

2. **Obtain the credentials file**:

   **Option A: Retrieve from Google Cloud Secrets Manager (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret="sql-proxy-key" --format="get(payload.data)" | base64 -d > sql-proxy-key.json
   ```

   **Option B: Generate new credentials** (only if Option A doesn't work or you need custom credentials):
   
   First, create a service account and grant permissions:
   ```bash
   # Create a Service Account
   gcloud iam service-accounts create sql-proxy-service \
       --description="Service account for Cloud SQL Proxy" \
       --display-name="SQL Proxy Service Account"
   
   # Grant necessary permissions
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
       --member="serviceAccount:sql-proxy-service@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/cloudsql.client"
   
   # Generate the credentials file
   gcloud iam service-accounts keys create sql-proxy-key.json \
       --iam-account=sql-proxy-service@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   ```

### Setting Up the Database Proxy

#### For Linux Users (Automated Service Setup)

1. **Copy the credentials file** to the infrastructure scripts directory:
```bash
cp sql-proxy-key.json <repo root>/infrastructure/scripts/
```

2. **Download the Cloud SQL Proxy binary** (if not already present):
```bash
cd  <repo root>/infrastructure/scripts
wget https://dl.google.com/cloudsql/cloud_sql_proxy.linux.amd64 -O cloud-sql-proxy
chmod +x cloud-sql-proxy
```

3. **Install the database proxy service**:
```bash
cd <repo root>/infrastructure/scripts
sudo ./setup-db-proxy-service.sh install
```

4. **Start the proxy service**:
```bash
sudo ./setup-db-proxy-service.sh start
```

5. **Verify the service is running**:
```bash
sudo ./setup-db-proxy-service.sh status
```

#### For macOS Users (Manual Proxy Execution)

**Note**: macOS users cannot use `setup-db-proxy-service.sh` as it creates Linux systemd services. Instead, use the direct proxy script:

1. **Copy the credentials file** to the infrastructure scripts directory:
```bash
cp sql-proxy-key.json <repo root>/infrastructure/scripts/
```

2. **Download the Cloud SQL Proxy binary for macOS** (if not already present):

   **First, check your Mac's architecture:**
   ```bash
   uname -m
   ```
   
   **Then download the correct version based on your result:**
   
   **For Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3) - if `uname -m` shows `arm64`:**
   ```bash
   cd <repo root>/infrastructure/scripts
   curl -L https://dl.google.com/cloudsql/cloud_sql_proxy.darwin.arm64 -o cloud-sql-proxy
   chmod +x cloud-sql-proxy
   ```
   
   **For Intel Macs - if `uname -m` shows `x86_64`:**
   ```bash
   cd <repo root>/infrastructure/scripts
   curl -L https://dl.google.com/cloudsql/cloud_sql_proxy.darwin.amd64 -o cloud-sql-proxy
   chmod +x cloud-sql-proxy
   ```

3. **Verify the download and run the database proxy:**
   ```bash
   # Verify the binary works
   ./cloud-sql-proxy --version
   
   # Run the database proxy directly (each time you need it)
   ./db-proxy.sh
   ```

**Important for macOS users**: You'll need to run `./db-proxy.sh` each time you start development, as it doesn't install as a persistent service like on Linux.

### Managing the Proxy Service (Linux Only)

For Linux users who installed the proxy as a service:

- **View logs**: `sudo ./setup-db-proxy-service.sh logs`
- **Follow logs in real-time**: `sudo ./setup-db-proxy-service.sh follow-logs`
- **Restart service**: `sudo ./setup-db-proxy-service.sh restart`
- **Stop service**: `sudo ./setup-db-proxy-service.sh stop`
- **Uninstall service**: `sudo ./setup-db-proxy-service.sh uninstall`

**For macOS users**: Since you're running the proxy manually with `./db-proxy.sh`, you can stop it with `Ctrl+C` and restart by running the script again.

### Environment Configuration

**⚠️ Required**: The environment must be properly configured before the backend can run. The `.env` file contains essential configuration including database credentials, API keys, and other environment-specific settings.

#### Option 1: Obtain from Google Cloud Secrets Manager (Recommended)

The complete `.env` file can be retrieved from Google Cloud Secrets Manager:

```bash
# Retrieve the .env file from Secrets Manager
gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret="env-backend" > .env

# Verify the file was created
ls -la .env
```

#### Option 2: Manual Configuration

If configuring manually, update your `.env` file to use the Unix socket created by the proxy:

```bash
# For Cloud SQL via Unix socket
DB_HOST=/cloudsql/YOUR_PROJECT_ID:REGION:INSTANCE_ID
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# Additional required environment variables (examples)
# API_KEY=your_api_key
# JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
# ENVIRONMENT=development
```

**Note**: Ensure your `.env` file is placed in the `apps/backend/` directory and never commit it to version control.

### Security Notes

- **Never commit** the `sql-proxy-key.json` file to version control
- **Never commit** the `.env` file to version control - it contains sensitive credentials
- **Rotate credentials** periodically for security
- **Use least privilege** - only grant necessary permissions to the service account
- **Monitor access** through Google Cloud Console audit logs
- **Secrets Manager access** - Ensure you have appropriate permissions to access the `env-backend` secret

### Troubleshooting

#### For Linux Users
- **Connection issues**: Check if the proxy service is running with `sudo systemctl status db-proxy`
- **Permission errors**: Verify the service account has `roles/cloudsql.client` role
- **Instance connection**: Ensure the Cloud SQL instance allows connections and is in the correct region

#### For macOS Users
- **Connection issues**: Ensure `./db-proxy.sh` is running in a terminal and hasn't stopped
- **Permission errors**: Verify the service account has `roles/cloudsql.client` role
- **Binary issues**: 
  - Check your Mac's architecture with `uname -m`
  - For Apple Silicon (arm64): Use `cloud_sql_proxy.darwin.arm64`
  - For Intel (x86_64): Use `cloud_sql_proxy.darwin.amd64`
  - If you get "Bad CPU type in executable", you downloaded the wrong architecture
- **Instance connection**: Ensure the Cloud SQL instance allows connections and is in the correct region

### Additional Options for macOS Users

If the direct `db-proxy.sh` method above doesn't work for your setup, you can:
1. **Use Docker**: Run the backend in a Docker container with Linux
2. **Manual Cloud SQL Proxy**: Download and run the [Cloud SQL Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/sql-proxy) manually
3. **Development Environment**: Use a Linux VM or cloud development environment

## 🔧 RH CLI Tool

The repository includes a unified CLI tool for managing development servers:

```bash
./rh backend start    # Start the backend server
./rh frontend start   # Start the frontend server
./rh help            # Show available commands
```

Run these commands from the repository root. The CLI provides a consistent interface for starting both services with beautiful, colorful output and proper error handling.

## 🤖 Automated PR Creation Tool

The repository includes an intelligent PR creation tool that streamlines the pull request process:

```bash
.github/pr [base-branch]
```

**Features:**
- 🎯 **Smart title generation** - Automatically formats branch names into proper titles
- 📝 **Detailed descriptions** - Includes commit summaries, changed files, and checklists
- 🔤 **Proper capitalization** - Handles technical abbreviations (API, UI, DB, etc.)
- ✅ **Ready-to-use templates** - Pre-filled checklists and sections
- 🌐 **Browser integration** - Option to open PR in browser after creation

**Prerequisites:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated (see setup steps above)
- Must be run from a feature branch (not main/master)

**Examples:**
```bash
.github/pr          # Create PR against main branch
.github/pr develop  # Create PR against develop branch
```

**Note:** If GitHub CLI is not installed, the tool will display an error and guide you to install it first.

## 🔄 Development Workflow

**📋 Prerequisites**: Before starting development, ensure you have completed:
1. [Cloud Database Setup](#cloud-database-setup-currently-required-for-backend) - Currently required as the backend needs a database connection to run (local database support coming in the future)
2. [Environment Configuration](#environment-configuration) - The `.env` file must be properly configured with all required variables

1. 🌿 **Create a new branch for your feature**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. 🪝 **Enable pre-commit hooks**:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

3. 🚀 **Start the development server** (choose one method):

   **Option A: Use the unified CLI from repository root:**
   ```bash
   ./rh backend start
   ```

   **Option B: Use the backend start script directly:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/backend
   ./start.sh
   ```

   **Option C: Run manually:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn rhesis.backend.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --log-level debug --reload
   ```

4. Make your changes and ensure all checks pass (if a Makefile is present, use it):
```bash
make format      # Format code with Ruff
make lint        # Lint code with Ruff
make type-check  # Type check with mypy
make test        # Run tests
```
Or run all checks at once:
```bash
make all
```

5. Commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your descriptive commit message"
```

6. Push your changes and create a Pull Request:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

7. **Create a Pull Request** using the automated PR tool:
```bash
.github/pr
```
This tool will automatically generate a professional PR with proper title formatting, detailed description, commit summaries, and a comprehensive checklist.

## 🔒 Dependency Locking

We use `uv lock` to generate a lock file for reproducible installs. By default, `uv lock` only locks main dependencies. To include dev dependencies (and any other optional groups), use the `--extra` flag:

```bash
uv lock --extra dev
```

You can specify multiple extras if needed:
```bash
uv lock --extra dev --extra docs
```

| Command                                 | Locks main deps | Locks dev deps | Locks other extras |
|------------------------------------------|:--------------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|
| `uv lock`                               |      ✅        |      ❌        |        ❌          |
| `uv lock --extra dev`                   |      ✅        |      ✅        |        ❌          |
| `uv lock --extra dev --extra docs`      |      ✅        |      ✅        |        ✅          |

**Best Practice:**
- Always use `uv lock --extra dev` to ensure your lock file includes all development dependencies.
- Add more `--extra` flags as needed for other optional dependency groups.
