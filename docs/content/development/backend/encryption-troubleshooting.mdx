# Encryption Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Diagnostics

### Check Encryption Status

```bash
# Verify DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY is set
echo $DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY

# Test encryption/decryption
python -c "from rhesis.backend.app.utils.encryption import encrypt, decrypt; print('✓ Working')"
```

### Verify Database Encryption

```sql
-- Count encrypted vs plaintext values (plaintext_count should be 0 after migration)
SELECT
    'endpoint' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE auth_token LIKE 'gAAAAA%') as encrypted,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE auth_token IS NOT NULL AND NOT auth_token LIKE 'gAAAAA%') as plaintext
FROM endpoint WHERE auth_token IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'model',
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE key LIKE 'gAAAAA%'),
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE key IS NOT NULL AND NOT key LIKE 'gAAAAA%')
FROM model WHERE key IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'token',
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE token LIKE 'gAAAAA%'),
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE token IS NOT NULL AND NOT token LIKE 'gAAAAA%')
FROM token WHERE token IS NOT NULL;
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: "DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable is not set"

**Solution:**

```bash
# Generate key
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"

# Set in environment
export DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY="<generated-key>"

# For production: Update Kubernetes secret or GCP Secret Manager
```

---

### Issue: "Invalid encrypted data or wrong encryption key"

**Cause:** Using different encryption key than when data was encrypted

**Solution:**

- Verify same key across all instances: `echo $DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY | md5sum`
- Check if key was recently changed - restore correct key from backup
- Ensure Kubernetes secrets match across environments

---

### Issue: Endpoint/Model API Calls Failing

**Cause:** Token not decrypting properly

**Diagnosis:**

```python
# Check if value is encrypted in DB
from rhesis.backend.app.utils.encryption import is_encrypted
print(is_encrypted(endpoint.auth_token))  # Should be False (auto-decrypted by ORM)
```

**Solution:**

- Verify encryption key is correct
- Check logs for decryption errors: `kubectl logs -l app=rhesis-backend | grep -i decrypt`
- Re-save the record to re-encrypt with current key

---

### Issue: Migration Failed Partway Through

**Solution:**

- Migration is idempotent - safe to re-run: `alembic upgrade head`
- Already encrypted values will be skipped
- Check database connection and timeout settings

---

### Issue: Performance Degradation

**Expected:** ~1-2ms overhead per encrypt/decrypt operation

**Check:**

- Monitor CPU usage: `kubectl top pods -l app=rhesis-backend`
- Verify connection pool settings (pool_size=10, max_overflow=20)
- Check for N+1 query patterns

---

### Issue: "Found unencrypted value" Warnings

**Solution:**

- Re-run migration: `alembic upgrade head`
- Or manually re-save affected records to trigger encryption

## Debug Script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Quick encryption status check"""
from rhesis.backend.app.database import SessionLocal
from rhesis.backend.app.models.endpoint import Endpoint
from rhesis.backend.app.models.model import Model
from rhesis.backend.app.models.token import Token
from rhesis.backend.app.utils.encryption import is_encrypted

db = SessionLocal()

for table, model, field in [
    ("endpoint", Endpoint, "auth_token"),
    ("model", Model, "key"),
    ("token", Token, "token")
]:
    records = db.query(model).all()
    encrypted = sum(1 for r in records if getattr(r, field, None) and is_encrypted(getattr(r, field)))
    total = sum(1 for r in records if getattr(r, field, None))
    print(f"{table}: {encrypted}/{total} encrypted")
```

## Verification Queries

```sql
-- After migration, all should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM endpoint
WHERE (auth_token IS NOT NULL AND NOT auth_token LIKE 'gAAAAA%')
   OR (client_secret IS NOT NULL AND NOT client_secret LIKE 'gAAAAA%')
   OR (last_token IS NOT NULL AND NOT last_token LIKE 'gAAAAA%');

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM model WHERE key IS NOT NULL AND NOT key LIKE 'gAAAAA%';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM token WHERE token IS NOT NULL AND NOT token LIKE 'gAAAAA%';
```

## Getting Help

### Log Collection

```bash
# Collect encryption-related logs
kubectl logs -l app=rhesis-backend -n rhesis-prod --since=1h | grep -i "encrypt\|decrypt" > logs.txt
```
