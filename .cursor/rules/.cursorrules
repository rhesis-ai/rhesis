- If interacting with the backend API, always check the interfaces first under ./utils/api-client.
- Always look for other pages doing similar interactions with the API.
- Always use the basedatagrid when using a grid.
- If running into issues. Check if things work similarly in a different place of the app.
- Never use the name as the key in the Autocomplete component, always use the id.
- Do not use the regular grid, use stack instead. Grid is deprecated.
