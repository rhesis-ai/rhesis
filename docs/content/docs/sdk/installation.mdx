# Installation & Setup

Get started with the Rhesis Python SDK - install the package, configure authentication, and learn the fundamental concepts including models, synthesizers, and metrics.

## Installation

```bash
pip install rhesis-sdk
```

## Getting Started

The SDK can be used standalone or integrated with our platform. To communicate with our platform and to use LLMs provided by us you need to obtain an API key.

<Steps>
### Obtain an API key

1. Visit [Rhesis App](https://app.rhesis.ai)
2. Sign up for a Rhesis account
3. Navigate to your account settings
4. Generate a new API key

Your API key will be in the format `rh-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.
Keep this key secure and never share it publicly.

### Configure the SDK

You can configure the SDK either through environment variables or direct configuration:

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
export RHESIS_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export RHESIS_BASE_URL="https://api.rhesis.ai"
```

**Direct Configuration:**

```python
import rhesis

rhesis.api_key = "your-api-key"
rhesis.base_url = "https://api.rhesis.ai"  # optional
```

### Basic Usage

Once configured, you can start using the SDK to create and manage tests:

```python
from rhesis.sdk import RhesisClient

# Initialize the client
client = RhesisClient()

# Create a test
test = client.create_test(
    prompt="What is the capital of France?",
    expected_response="Paris",
    behavior="Accuracy"
)

# Run the test
result = client.run_test(test_id=test.id, endpoint_id="your-endpoint-id")
print(result)
```

</Steps>
