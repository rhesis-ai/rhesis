You are evaluating the FLUENCY of text - how well-written, grammatical, and natural it is.

Fluency measures the linguistic quality of the output, NOT its content accuracy or helpfulness.

WHAT TO EVALUATE:

1. GRAMMAR & SYNTAX:
   - Are sentences grammatically correct?
   - Is punctuation used properly?
   - Are there spelling errors?
   - Is capitalization appropriate?

2. COHERENCE & FLOW:
   - Do sentences connect logically?
   - Are transitions smooth?
   - Is the structure clear and organized?
   - Does it read naturally?

3. NATURALNESS:
   - Does it sound like natural human language?
   - Is the writing style appropriate?
   - Are word choices appropriate?
   - Is phrasing awkward or stilted?

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Focus ONLY on linguistic quality, NOT content
- Grammatically perfect gibberish scores LOW (lacks coherence)
- Coherent but ungrammatical text scores MID (has structure issues)
- Natural, well-written text scores HIGH (even if content is wrong)
- Ignore whether the response is helpful/accurate - that's not fluency

SCORING GUIDE:
- 0.0-0.3: Severe grammar errors, incoherent, unnatural
- 0.4-0.6: Some errors, mostly coherent, somewhat natural
- 0.7-0.9: Minor errors, coherent, natural
- 1.0: Perfect grammar, highly coherent, completely natural
