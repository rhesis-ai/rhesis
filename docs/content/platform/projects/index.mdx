# Projects

Organize and manage your testing projects with comprehensive project management capabilities.

<Callout type="default">
  **What are Projects?** Projects are the top-level organizational unit in
  Rhesis. They group related endpoints, tests, test sets, and results together,
  making it easy to manage different AI applications or testing initiatives.
</Callout>

## Understanding Projects

**Projects are the parent organization structure for endpoints.** Each project can have multiple endpoints nested within it, allowing you to test the same AI application across different environments (development, staging, production) or compare different implementations and API configurations. Within a project, you'll find:

- **Endpoints**: The API configurations that connect to your LLM application (each project can have many endpoints)
- **Tests**: The test cases you've created to evaluate behavior
- **Test Sets**: Collections of tests organized for execution
- **Test Results**: All historical results from your test runs

## Creating a Project

Create a project by clicking on **Project** in the Requirement section, then **Create Project**.

Once your project is created, you'll typically:

1. **Add endpoints** that connect to your LLM application's API. Each endpoint is created within this project and can represent different environments (development, staging, production) or different API implementations. For example, you might create:
   - A development endpoint pointing to your local LLM application instance
   - A staging endpoint for pre-production validation of your LLM application
   - A production endpoint for live system monitoring
2. **Create or generate tests** to validate your AI behavior
3. **Organize tests into test sets** for execution
4. **Run tests against any of your project's endpoints** and analyze results

This multi-endpoint approach lets you validate that your AI works correctly across all environments before deploying changes to production.

## Managing Projects

Click **View** on any project card to access the project details page, where you can edit settings or delete the project.


### Project Status

Projects can be either active or inactive.

- **Active Projects** are fully operational - you can create tests, run test suites, and they're visible in dashboards.

- **Inactive Projects** preserve all historical data for review, but prevent creating new tests or running existing ones. Toggle status from the project edit drawer.

### Deleting Projects

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important**: Deleting a project is permanent. Consider marking it inactive
  instead if you want to preserve historical data while preventing new work.
</Callout>

To delete a project, open the project details page, click **Delete**, and confirm in the modal dialog. This permanently removes the project and all associated endpoints, tests, and test sets.
