## Pre-Commit Workflow

### 1. Check Current Status
Before creating commits, always review your current changes:

```bash
# Check which files have been modified
git status

# See detailed changes in all modified files
git diff

# See changes in specific files
git diff <filename>

# See staged vs unstaged changes
git diff --cached  # Shows staged changes
git diff HEAD      # Shows all changes (staged + unstaged)
```

### 2. Review and Analyze Changes
- Identify what functionality was added, modified, or removed
- Group related changes by:
  - Feature additions
  - Bug fixes
  - Refactoring
  - Documentation updates
  - Configuration changes
  - Test modifications

### 3. Stage Changes Strategically
Instead of `git add .`, stage files selectively:

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add <file1> <file2>

# Stage parts of files interactively
git add -p <filename>

# Stage all files of a certain type
git add *.py
git add *.md

# Review what's staged
git diff --cached
```

## Logical Commit Grouping

### Group Changes By:

1. **Feature Scope**: Each new feature should be its own commit
2. **Bug Fixes**: Each bug fix should be separate
3. **Refactoring**: Code improvements without functional changes
4. **Documentation**: README, comments, or doc updates
5. **Configuration**: Settings, dependencies, or build changes
6. **Tests**: New tests or test modifications

### Example Workflow:

```bash
# 1. Check what changed
git status
git diff

# 2. If you have mixed changes, create separate commits:

# Commit 1: Fix a specific bug
git add src/bug-file.py tests/test-bug-fix.py
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve timeout issue in user endpoint"

# Commit 2: Add new feature
git add src/feature-file.py src/feature-helper.py
git commit -m "feat(auth): add two-factor authentication"

# Commit 3: Update documentation
git add README.md docs/api.md
git commit -m "docs: update authentication setup guide"

# Commit 4: Refactor existing code
git add src/utils.py
git commit -m "refactor(utils): simplify date formatting functions"
```

## Conventional Commits Rule

Always follow the Conventional Commits specification for all commit messages.

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

### Rules
1. Use lowercase for type and description
2. No period at the end of the description
3. Use imperative mood in the description (e.g., "add" not "adds" or "added")
4. Limit the description to 50 characters or less
5. Use optional scope to specify the component/module affected (e.g., `feat(auth): add login validation`)
6. Add body and footer if needed for breaking changes or additional context
7. Use `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer for breaking changes

### Examples
- `feat: add user authentication`
- `fix(api): resolve timeout issue in user endpoint`
- `docs: update installation guide`
- `refactor(utils): simplify date formatting function`
- `feat!: remove deprecated API endpoints` (! indicates breaking change)

## Advanced Git Commands for Commit Management

### Splitting Large Changes

```bash
# If you have too many changes in one file, split them:
git add -p <filename>  # Interactively stage hunks

# Reset specific files from staging
git reset <filename>

# Reset specific hunks
git reset -p <filename>
```

### Amending and Fixing Commits

```bash
# Add more changes to the last commit
git add <forgotten-file>
git commit --amend

# Change the last commit message
git commit --amend -m "new commit message"

# Interactive rebase to reorganize recent commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Edit last 3 commits
```

### Commit Message Templates

For complex commits, use the full format:

```
feat(auth): add two-factor authentication support

- Implement TOTP-based 2FA using Google Authenticator
- Add backup codes for account recovery
- Update user settings page with 2FA controls
- Add email notifications for 2FA events

Closes #123
BREAKING CHANGE: Users must now verify email before enabling 2FA
```

## Best Practices

1. **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change
2. **Frequent Commits**: Commit early and often, but keep commits meaningful
3. **Clear History**: Your commit history should tell a story of your project's evolution
4. **Review Before Push**: Always review your commits before pushing
5. **Test Each Commit**: Ideally, each commit should leave the codebase in a working state

## Quick Checklist Before Committing

- [ ] Run `git status` to see what's changed
- [ ] Run `git diff` to review the actual changes
- [ ] Group related changes together
- [ ] Write descriptive commit messages following conventional commits
- [ ] Test that each commit doesn't break functionality
- [ ] Consider if any commit needs a longer description or breaking change notice

When creating commits, always format them according to this specification and follow the logical grouping workflow.
