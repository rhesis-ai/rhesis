# Knowledge

The Knowledge section provides documentation about Rhesis's core concepts and methodologies for AI testing and evaluation.

## What are Sources?

Sources are content that you add to Rhesis to provide context and domain knowledge for AI testing. They serve as the foundation for generating relevant, domain-specific test cases.

### Source Types

Rhesis currently supports:

- **Document**: Uploaded files (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, text files, etc.)
- **Tool**: Pages imported from MCP servers (e.g., Notion pages)

<Callout type="info">
  **Future Support**: Additional source types including Website, API, Database,
  Code, and Manual are planned for future releases.
</Callout>

### Supported File Formats

When adding documents, Rhesis supports a wide range of file formats:

**Office Documents:**

- `.docx` - Microsoft Word documents
- `.pptx` - Microsoft PowerPoint presentations
- `.xlsx` - Microsoft Excel spreadsheets

**Documents:**

- `.pdf` - PDF files
- `.txt` - Plain text files
- `.csv` - Comma-separated values
- `.json` - JSON data files
- `.xml` - XML documents
- `.html`, `.htm` - HTML web pages

**Archives:**

- `.zip` - Compressed archives (contents are extracted)

**E-books:**

- `.epub` - Electronic book format

## How Sources Work

### Adding Sources

You can add sources in two ways:

1. **Upload Documents**: Upload files directly from your computer
2. **Import from MCP**: Import pages from connected MCP servers (see [MCP documentation](/docs/platform/mcp))

### Storage and Processing

When you add a source:

1. **Content Storage**: The content is securely stored in your organization's storage
2. **Content Extraction**: Text content is automatically extracted using [Markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)
3. **Metadata Creation**: Source information (type, size, date added) is stored
4. **Source Record**: A source record is created with the extracted content and metadata

You can then view details, browse extracted content, download the original file, edit metadata (title, description, tags), and add comments.

### Importing from MCP

To import sources from MCP servers:

1. Click "Import Source from MCP" on the Knowledge page
2. Select an MCP tool (e.g., Notion connection)
3. Enter a search query to find pages
4. Select pages from the results
5. Click "Import as Sources" to save them

<Callout type="warning">
  **Search Errors**: If you encounter an error when searching, try again. The search agent is non-deterministic and may occasionally fail, but retrying may resolve the issue.
</Callout>

## Using Sources for Test Generation

### Current Capabilities

Sources are currently used in the Knowledge section to:

- **Store Domain Knowledge**: Add content that contains domain-specific information
- **Extract Content**: Automatically extract and view text content from sources
- **Organize Information**: Categorize and tag sources for easy management

<Callout type="info">
  **Coming Soon**: Sources will be integrated with test generation to
  automatically create domain-specific test cases.
