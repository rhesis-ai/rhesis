# Installation

Penelope is currently available as part of the Rhesis monorepo and uses `uv` for dependency management.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Git

## Installation Steps

<Steps>

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhesis-ai/rhesis.git
cd rhesis/penelope
```

### Install Dependencies

**Using uv (recommended):**

```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install:
- All Penelope dependencies
- The local Rhesis SDK from `../sdk` (automatically linked)
- Development tools

**Or install in development mode:**

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

</Steps>

## Verify Installation

Test that Penelope is correctly installed:

```python
from rhesis.penelope import PenelopeAgent

# If this runs without errors, you're ready to go!
agent = PenelopeAgent()
print("Penelope is ready! 🦸‍♀️")
```

## Local SDK Integration

<Callout type="info">
  **Important:** Penelope automatically uses the local SDK from `../sdk` in the monorepo. This ensures you're always using the latest SDK features without version conflicts.
</Callout>

The monorepo configuration in `pyproject.toml` handles this automatically:

```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
rhesis-sdk = \{ path = "../sdk", editable = true \}
```

## Development Setup

For contributing to Penelope, install additional development dependencies:

```bash
cd rhesis/penelope
uv sync
```

This installs:
- Testing tools (pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock)
- Linting tools (ruff, pyright)
- All SDK dependencies

### Available Commands

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run type checking
make type-check

# Run linting
make lint

# Run formatting
make format

# Run all checks
make all
```
