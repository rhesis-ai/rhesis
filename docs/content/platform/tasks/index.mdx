# Tasks

Organize and track testing work with integrated task management that connects directly to your tests, test sets, and results.

## Overview

Tasks help teams coordinate work related to testing activities within Rhesis. Use tasks to track test failures, plan test development, organize reviews, and maintain accountability throughout your testing lifecycle.


Tasks can be linked to specific tests, test sets, or test results to provide full context for the work that needs to be done.


## Task Properties

Each task includes the following properties to help organize and track work:

| Property | Options | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Status** | Open, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled | The current state of the task |
| **Priority** | Low, Medium, High | The urgency level for completing the task |
| **Creator** | User | Person who created the task (automatically set) |
| **Assignee** | User (optional) | Team member responsible for completing the task |
| **Title** | Text | Short, descriptive name for the task |
| **Description** | Text | Detailed information about the task |

### Linked Resources

Tasks can be associated with specific resources to provide context:

| Resource Type | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **Test** | Link to a specific test that needs attention or development |
| **Test Set** | Link to a collection of tests for batch operations or reviews |
| **Test Result** | Link to a test execution result that requires follow-up |

You can create tasks from the [Tasks](https://app.rhesis.ai/tasks) page, or across the platform in [Test Results](https://app.rhesis.ai/test-results), [Tests](https://app.rhesis.ai/tests) or [Test Sets](https://app.rhesis.ai/test-sets).
