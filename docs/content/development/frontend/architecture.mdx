## Project Structure

The frontend codebase follows a modular architecture organized by feature and responsibility:

## Key Architectural Patterns

### App Router

The application uses Next.js App Router for routing, which provides:
- File-based routing
- Route groups for organization
- Layout nesting
- Server components
- Client components where needed
- Route protection with middleware

### Component Architecture

Components follow these principles:
- **Atomic Design:** Building from small, reusable components to complex page layouts
- **Component Composition:** Favoring composition over inheritance
- **Separation of Concerns:** UI components are separate from data fetching and business logic
- **Typed Props:** All components have well-defined TypeScript interfaces

### Data Flow

The application follows these data flow patterns:
- **Server Components:** Fetch data on the server when possible
- **React Context:** For global state management
- **Server Actions:** For mutations and form submissions
- **API Client:** Type-safe API integration

### Authentication

Authentication is handled by NextAuth.js with:
- Route protection via middleware
- Session management
- Multiple authentication providers (Google, etc.)
- Role-based access control

### Styling Approach

The styling system uses:
- MUI's theming system
- Emotion for CSS-in-JS
- Responsive design principles
- Design tokens for consistent styling

## Performance Considerations

- Server components for improved initial load times
- Client components only where interactivity is required
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Route prefetching
- Code splitting
