Base schema for all schemas

This module contains the base schema for all schemas in the application. 
Note using Pydantic together with SQLAlchemy leads to a lot of code duplication.
This is a known issue and there are some workarounds. One of them is to use 
helper libraries such as pydantic_sqlalchemy as future improvement.
