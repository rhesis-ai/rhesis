Evaluate this conversation against the stated goal.

TEST GOAL (what should be achieved):
{{ goal }}

TEST INSTRUCTIONS (how the test was conducted):
{{ instructions }}

CONVERSATION:
{{ conversation }}

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Count the user-assistant exchanges (USER + ASSISTANT = 1 turn)
2. Break down the goal into specific measurable criteria
3. Evaluate each criterion individually with evidence
4. For EACH criterion, identify which turn numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) are relevant
5. Determine if ALL criteria are met

Your response must follow the structured format with:
- turn_count: actual number of user-assistant exchanges
- criteria_evaluations: each criterion evaluated separately, including:
  * criterion: what is being evaluated
  * met: true/false
  * evidence: specific quotes or observations
  * relevant_turns: list of turn numbers [1, 2, 3] where this criterion was tested
- all_criteria_met: logical AND of all criteria
- goal_achieved: final assessment

IMPORTANT: For relevant_turns, include ALL turns where evidence for or against the criterion appears.
If a criterion applies to the entire conversation, include all turn numbers.
