# Penelope 🦸‍♀️

**Intelligent Multi-Turn Testing Agent for AI Applications**

Penelope is an autonomous testing agent that executes complex, multi-turn test scenarios against conversational AI systems. She combines sophisticated reasoning with adaptive testing strategies to thoroughly evaluate AI applications across security, user experience, compliance, edge cases, and more.

## What is Penelope?

Penelope automates testing that requires:

- **Multiple interactions** - Extended conversations, not one-shot prompts
- **Adaptive behavior** - Adjusting strategy based on responses
- **Tool use** - Making requests, analyzing data, extracting information
- **Goal orientation** - Knowing when the test is complete
- **Reasoning** - Understanding context and planning next steps

Think of Penelope as a QA engineer who executes test plans autonomously through conversation.

## Quick Example

<CodeBlock filename="basic_test.py" language="python">
{`from rhesis.penelope import EndpointTarget, PenelopeAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = PenelopeAgent(enable_transparency=True)

# Create target
target = EndpointTarget(endpoint_id="your-endpoint-id")

# Execute test - Penelope plans the approach
result = agent.execute_test(
    target=target,
    goal="Verify chatbot can answer 3 questions about policies maintaining context",
)

print(f"Goal achieved: {result.goal_achieved}")
print(f"Turns used: {result.turns_used}")`}
</CodeBlock>

## What Makes Penelope Unique?

- **True Multi-Turn Understanding** - Native support for stateful conversations with full context retention
- **Provider Agnostic** - Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI, and any OpenAI-compatible provider
- **Target Flexible** - Test Rhesis endpoints, LangChain apps, CrewAI agents, or any conversational system
- **Smart Defaults** - Specify just a goal, Penelope plans the testing approach herself
- **LLM-Driven Evaluation** - Goal achievement evaluated by LLMs, not brittle heuristics
- **Transparent Reasoning** - See Penelope's thought process at each step
- **Type-Safe** - Full Pydantic validation from config to results

## Design Philosophy

Built following [Anthropic's agent engineering principles](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents):

1. **Simplicity** - Single-purpose agent with clear responsibilities
2. **Transparency** - Explicit reasoning at each step
3. **Quality ACI** - Extensively documented tools with clear usage patterns
4. **Ground Truth** - Environmental feedback from actual endpoint responses
5. **Stopping Conditions** - Clear termination criteria
