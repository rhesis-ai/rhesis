# Platform

The Rhesis platform provides comprehensive tools for testing and evaluating AI applications at scale.

## Why Rhesis?

Testing AI applications is fundamentally different from traditional software testing. Rhesis is purpose-built for AI testing:

- **AI-Native Testing**: Generate tests using AI, evaluate responses with LLMs
- **Scale**: Test thousands of scenarios automatically
- **Insight**: Track quality trends, catch regressions, compare models
- **Collaboration**: Multi-user workflows with roles and permissions
- **Integration**: Works with any AI model or framework
