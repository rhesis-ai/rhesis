# Penelope 🦸‍♀️

**Intelligent Multi-Turn Testing Agent for AI Applications**

Penelope is an autonomous testing agent that executes complex, multi-turn test scenarios against conversational AI systems. She combines sophisticated reasoning with adaptive testing strategies to thoroughly evaluate AI applications across any dimension: security, user experience, compliance, edge cases, and more.

## What is Penelope?

Penelope automates the kind of testing that requires:

- **Multiple interactions**: Not just one-shot prompts, but extended conversations
- **Adaptive behavior**: Adjusting strategy based on responses  
- **Tool use**: Making requests, analyzing data, extracting information
- **Goal orientation**: Knowing when the test is complete
- **Resource utilization**: Leveraging context and documentation

Think of Penelope as a QA engineer who can execute test plans autonomously through conversation.

## Quick Start

```python
from rhesis.penelope import PenelopeAgent, EndpointTarget

# Initialize Penelope
agent = PenelopeAgent()

# Create target
target = EndpointTarget(endpoint_id="my-chatbot-prod")

# Execute a test - Penelope plans its own approach
result = agent.execute_test(
    target=target,
    goal="Verify chatbot can answer 3 questions about insurance policies while maintaining context",
)

print(f"Goal achieved: {result.goal_achieved}")
print(f"Turns used: {result.turns_used}")
```

### Infinite Loop Prevention

Penelope includes built-in guardrails to prevent infinite loops and runaway costs:

- **Global execution limit**: By default, limits total tool executions to `max_iterations × 5` (e.g., 10 turns × 5 = 50 executions)
- **Workflow validation**: Blocks known bad patterns (excessive analysis tools, repetitive usage)
- **Progress warnings**: Alerts at 60% and 80% of limits

For complex tests that need more executions:

```python
agent = PenelopeAgent(
    max_iterations=20,  # Allow more turns
    max_tool_executions=150  # Override default (20 × 5 = 100)
)
```

Or configure globally via environment variable:

```bash
export PENELOPE_MAX_TOOL_EXECUTIONS_MULTIPLIER=10  # More generous for complex tests
```

### Testing with Restrictions

Define forbidden behaviors the target must not exhibit:

```python
# Test that target respects business and compliance boundaries
result = agent.execute_test(
    target=target,
    goal="Verify insurance chatbot stays within policy boundaries",
    instructions="Ask about coverage, competitors, and medical conditions",
    restrictions="""
    - Must not mention competitor brands or products
    - Must not provide specific medical diagnoses
    - Must not guarantee coverage without policy review
    """,
)
```

## Installation

Penelope is part of the Rhesis monorepo and uses `uv` for dependency management.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rhesis-ai/rhesis.git
cd rhesis/penelope

# Install with uv
uv sync
```

**Note**: Penelope automatically uses the local SDK from `../sdk` in the monorepo.

### Running Examples

```bash
cd penelope/examples

# Basic example
uv run python basic_example.py --endpoint-id your-endpoint-id

# LangChain integration (uses Gemini)
uv sync --group langchain
uv run python langchain_minimal.py

# Testing with restrictions (demonstrates safety boundaries)
uv run python testing_with_restrictions.py --endpoint-id your-endpoint-id

# Security testing (with ethical constraints)
uv run python security_testing.py --endpoint-id your-endpoint-id
```

## Development

```bash
# Install development dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run type checking
make type-check

# Run linting
make lint

# Run all checks
make all
```

## Design Philosophy

Penelope follows [Anthropic's agent engineering principles](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents):

1. **Simplicity**: Single-purpose agent with clear responsibilities
2. **Transparency**: Explicit reasoning at each step
3. **Quality ACI**: Extensively documented tools with clear usage patterns
4. **Ground Truth**: Environmental feedback from actual endpoint responses
5. **Stopping Conditions**: Clear termination criteria
