# SDK Changelog

> **Migration Notice:** As of May 2025, this SDK has been migrated from its own repository 
> (https://github.com/rhesis-ai/rhesis-sdk) into the Rhesis main repo 
> (https://github.com/rhesis-ai/rhesis). All releases up to v0.1.8 were made in the original repository.
> While the SDK is at version 0.1.8 internally, it's included in the repository-wide v0.1.0 release tag
> for the initial release. After this, the SDK will continue with its own versioning using sdk-vX.Y.Z tags.

All notable changes to the Rhesis SDK will be documented in this file.
