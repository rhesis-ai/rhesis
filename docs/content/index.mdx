# Rhesis Documentation

**Gen AI Testing. Collaborative. Adaptive.**

From "I hope this works" to "I know this works." Rhesis brings your whole team together—developers, domain experts, legal, and marketing—to create comprehensive testing that ensures your Gen AI applications work exactly as intended before users see them.

## Why Rhesis?

You spent weeks or months building something innovative. Don't let inadequate testing ruin the release. Traditional testing approaches fail with Gen AI because responses are non-deterministic, quality is subjective, and edge cases are infinite. Rhesis brings together technical and domain expertise to create testing that's as sophisticated as your Gen AI architecture.

<FeatureOverview />

## Built for Teams, know what you ship!

Advanced testing architecture, collaborative by design. Rhesis works with any Gen AI system and integrates seamlessly into your existing development workflow.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the cloud platform (fastest)

Get started in minutes at [app.rhesis.ai](https://app.rhesis.ai):

1. **Create a free account**
2. **Start generating test scenarios collaboratively**
3. **Invite your team to define requirements together**

### Option 2: Use the SDK

Install and configure the Python SDK:

<CodeBlock filename="terminal" language="bash">
  {`pip install rhesis-sdk`}
</CodeBlock>

<details>
<summary>**Quick example**</summary>

<CodeBlock filename="app.py" language="python">
{`import rhesis
from rhesis.sdk.synthesizers.prompt_synthesizer import PromptSynthesizer

# Configuration

rhesis.api_key = "rh-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" # Get from app.rhesis.ai settings
rhesis.base_url = "https://api.rhesis.ai" # optional

synthesizer = PromptSynthesizer(
"Generate test cases for a doctor appointment scheduling chatbot"
)

test_set = synthesizer.generate(num_tests=4)

for test in test_set.tests:
print("-" \* 40)
print(f"Prompt: {test['prompt']['content']}")
print(f"Behavior: {test['behavior']}")
print(f"Category: {test['category']}")
print(f"Topic: {test['topic']}")

# Example output:

# ----------------------------------------

# Prompt: Schedule an appointment for me next week with Dr. Smith.

# Behavior: Reliability

# Category: Harmless

# Topic: Appointment Scheduling`}

</CodeBlock>

</details>

### Option 3: Run locally with Docker (zero configuration)

Get the full platform running locally with a single command - no configuration needed:

<CodeBlock filename="terminal" language="bash">
  {`git clone https://github.com/rhesis-ai/rhesis.git
cd rhesis
./rh start`}
</CodeBlock>

That's it! Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - you'll be automatically logged in to the dashboard!

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ Generates database encryption key
- ✅ Creates `.env.docker.local` with local configuration
- ✅ Enables auto-login (no Auth0 setup needed)
- ✅ Starts all services (backend, frontend, database, worker)
- ✅ Creates default admin user and example data

> **Note:** This is a simplified setup for local testing only. For production deployments, see the [Self-hosting Documentation](/getting-started/self-hosting).
