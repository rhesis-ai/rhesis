# Test Sets

<Callout type="default">
  **What are Test Sets?** Test Sets are groups of tests that can be executed together.
</Callout>

Test sets organize related tests into collections for batch execution. When you [generate tests](/platform/tests-generation), all created tests are automatically grouped into a single test set. You can also manually assign tests to test sets or remove them as needed.

Test sets inherit shared types, behaviors, categories, topics and sources from their tests.

## Executing Test Sets

Executing a test set runs all its tests against your AI application endpoint to see how your application responds. This creates a [Test Run](/platform/test-runs) that captures all results.

To execute a test set, select it from the [Test Sets page](https://app.rhesis.ai/test-sets) and configure:

**Execution Target**
- **Project**: The current project
- **Endpoint**: The endpoint within the project to execute tests against

**Execution Mode**
- **Parallel** (default): Tests run simultaneously for faster execution
- **Sequential**: Tests run one after another, better for rate-limited endpoints

**Tags**: Optional tags to categorize and find this test run
