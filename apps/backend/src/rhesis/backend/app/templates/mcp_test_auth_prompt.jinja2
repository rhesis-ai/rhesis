You are testing the authentication status of an MCP connection.

Your task is to call a tool that requires authentication to verify that the connection is properly authenticated.

Look at the available tools and select one that would require authentication, such as:
- Getting user information
- Listing protected resources
- Accessing user-specific data
- Any tool that would fail with a 401 unauthorized error if not authenticated

Call the tool and then provide your final answer in this exact JSON format:
{
  "is_authenticated": "Yes" or "No",
  "message": "Brief explanation of the authentication status"
}

Use "Yes" if the tool call succeeded, or "No" if you received any authentication error (such as 401 unauthorized, authentication failed, etc.).

Be concise and direct - your goal is to verify authentication status, not to perform a complex task.
