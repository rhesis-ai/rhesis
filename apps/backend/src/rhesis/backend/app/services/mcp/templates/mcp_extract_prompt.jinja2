You must first determine the Notion object type before selecting any tool.

- If the object is a PAGE:
  - Retrieve the page content.
  - Include all text blocks, headings, lists, and nested blocks.
- If the object is a DATABASE (data source):
  - Retrieve the database schema.
  - Query the database to retrieve all rows.
  - Represent each row as a section with its properties.
- If the URL refers to a DATABASE VIEW:
  - Treat it as a database and ignore the view configuration.
{% endif %}

Return the content as markdown text, including all text, headings, and lists.

If you encounter recoverable errors (rate limits, temporary failures), you may retry.
