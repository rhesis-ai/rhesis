"""sync_new_metrics_to_existing_orgs

This migration intelligently syncs newly added metrics from initial_data.json to all
existing organizations. It's fully idempotent and can be run multiple times - only
missing metrics will be added.

The migration uses the reusable metric_sync utility which:
1. Reads metrics from initial_data.json (single source of truth)
2. For each organization, checks which metrics are missing
3. Creates only the missing metrics
4. Can handle continuous additions of new metrics to initial_data.json

For new organizations, metrics are created during onboarding via load_initial_data.

Future migrations can reuse the sync_metrics_to_organizations function from:
    rhesis.backend.alembic.utils.metric_sync
