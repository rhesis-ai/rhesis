# Tests

Create and manage test cases for evaluating your AI applications.

<Callout type="default">
  **What are Tests?** Tests are individual prompts or inputs that you send to
  your AI application to evaluate its behavior. Each test contains a prompt,
  expected behavior, and optional metadata for organization and analysis.
</Callout>

## Why Tests?

Manual testing of AI applications doesn't scale beyond a handful of scenarios. Tests enable you to:

- **Ensure Quality**: Verify AI behavior across hundreds of scenarios automatically
- **Catch Regressions**: Detect when model updates or prompt changes break existing functionality
- **Document Behavior**: Tests serve as living documentation of expected AI responses
- **Enable CI/CD**: Integrate automated testing into your deployment pipeline
- **Generate at Scale**: Use AI to create comprehensive test coverage in minutes

## Understanding Tests

A test in Rhesis consists of the prompt or input you send to your AI application, along with metadata that helps organize and evaluate the results. Each test has a behavior that indicates what aspect of the AI you're testing (like Reliability, Safety, or Compliance), a topic that describes the subject matter, and a category for additional classification. You can optionally specify an expected response for comparison, and add metadata like priority, status, assignee, owner, tags, and source documents.

Tests can be created manually or generated using AI. Once created, tests are organized into test sets for execution.

## Creating Tests Manually

### Write a Single Test

Click **Write Test**, fill in the workflow information (status, assignee, owner) and test details (behavior, topic, category, priority, and prompt content), then click **Save**. The test is immediately available in your tests list.

## Generating Tests with AI

### Generation Wizard

The AI-powered test generation wizard creates multiple tests at once based on your configuration.

**Step 1: Configure Generation**

Start by selecting the project for your tests and choosing which behaviors you want to test, such as Reliability, Compliance, or Safety. Define the testing purpose—whether you're doing regression testing, validating a new feature, integration testing, exploring edge cases, or performance testing. Currently, the platform supports single-turn tests (a single prompt and response).

Decide whether you want the AI to generate prompts only, or to also generate expected responses for comparison. Choose your test coverage level: Focused (100 test cases), Standard (1,000 test cases), or Comprehensive (5,000 test cases). Add the topics you want your tests to cover, and provide a detailed description of what you want to test—this description is required and helps the AI understand your testing goals.

**Step 2: Upload Documents (Optional)**

Upload documents to provide context for test generation:

- Supported formats: `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.zip`, `.epub`
- Maximum file size: 5 MB
- System extracts content and generates metadata automatically
- Documents inform the AI about your application's domain and requirements

**Step 3: Review Samples**

The system generates 5 sample tests for you to evaluate. Rate each sample from 1 to 5 stars based on its quality. For any samples you rate below 4 stars, you can provide feedback explaining what needs improvement. Click **Regenerate** to create improved versions based on your feedback, or **Load More Samples** to generate additional samples if you want more variety. You must rate all samples before proceeding to the next step.

**[SCREENSHOT HERE: Test generation wizard Step 3 showing sample test cards with star rating interface, feedback text areas for low-rated samples, and buttons for "Regenerate", "Load More Samples", and "Next". Include the average rating indicator at the top.]**

**Step 4: Confirm & Generate**

Review your configuration and average sample rating. Click **Generate Tests** to start the generation process. You'll receive a notification when the tests are ready.

## Managing Tests

### Viewing Tests

The tests page displays all your tests in a grid showing the prompt text, behavior classification, topic, category, assigned team member, and counts for comments and tasks. Use the filters to find specific tests by any of these fields. Click a test row to view full details and execution history.

### Editing Tests

On the test detail page, click **Edit** buttons to modify the test executable or expected response. Update behavior, type, topic, or category by clicking the field. Changes save automatically.

### Organizing Tests

Add tags to categorize and find tests easily. When you're ready to run tests, select one or more from the grid and click **Assign to Test Set** to add them to a test set for execution. You can also update workflow fields like status, priority, assignee, or owner directly from the test detail page.

### Deleting Tests

Select one or more tests from the grid, click **Delete Tests**, and confirm. This removes only the test records; related comments and tasks are not deleted.

## Running Tests

### Quick Test Run

From the test detail page, click **Run Test**, select a project and endpoint, then click **Run Test** again to execute immediately. This runs the test without creating a full test run record.

## Test Details

The test detail page provides a comprehensive view of a single test and its execution history.

**[SCREENSHOT HERE: Test detail page showing statistics cards at the top (Last Test Run, Overall Pass Rate, Total Executions, Average Time), test information section with prompt and expected response, and workflow/collaboration sections on the side.]**

### Statistics

At the top, you'll see key metrics: the last test run (showing status, name, execution time, date, and metrics results), the overall pass rate comparing passed versus failed executions, the total number of times the test has been run, and the average execution time per run.

### Test Information

The main content area displays the test executable (the prompt sent to your AI), the expected response if one was specified, and classification fields like behavior, type, topic, and category. Any source documents associated with the test appear here, along with custom tags you've added.

### Workflow

Track the test's current state with workflow fields: status, priority, assignee (the responsible team member), and owner.

### Collaboration

Manage tasks and comments related to the test. Tasks represent action items that need attention, while comments facilitate team discussions about test results or improvements.

### Parent Tests

If a test has a parent test, a **Go to Parent** button appears at the top. This indicates the test was derived from another test.
