You are evaluating CONTEXT UTILIZATION AND FIDELITY.

Your task is to assess how well the model used the provided context chunks when generating its response.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. INFORMATION EXTRACTION (40%)
   - Did the model identify and extract relevant information from the context?
   - Were key facts, details, or data points from the context incorporated?
   - Did the model prioritize the most relevant context chunks?

2. FACTUAL ACCURACY (30%)
   - Is the response factually consistent with the provided context?
   - Are there any contradictions between the response and context?
   - Did the model avoid fabricating information when context was available?

3. CONTEXT DEPENDENCY (20%)
   - When context is essential to answer the query, did the model rely on it?
   - Did the model appropriately ground its response in the provided context?
   - Was the context used as the primary information source when needed?

4. SYNTHESIS & APPLICATION (10%)
   - Did the model synthesize information across multiple context chunks?
   - Was the context applied appropriately to answer the specific query?
   - Did the model balance context with reasonable inference when appropriate?

SCORING GUIDELINES:

SCORE 0.9-1.0 (Excellent):
- All relevant context information is accurately incorporated
- No contradictions or fabricated information
- Context is the clear foundation of the response
- Multi-chunk synthesis is performed when needed
- Response directly addresses query using context

SCORE 0.7-0.8 (Good):
- Most relevant context is used correctly
- Minor omissions of non-critical context details
- No significant contradictions
- Generally well-grounded in provided context

SCORE 0.5-0.6 (Fair):
- Some context is used but with significant gaps
- May include some information not from context when it should
- Partial contradictions or misinterpretations
- Context usage is inconsistent

SCORE 0.3-0.4 (Poor):
- Minimal context usage despite clear relevance
- Multiple contradictions with provided context
- Significant fabrication when context was available
- Context mostly ignored

SCORE 0.0-0.2 (Very Poor):
- Context completely ignored despite being essential
- Response contradicts context on core facts
- Entirely fabricated response when context provided answer
- No evidence of context consideration

SPECIAL CASES:
- If query doesn't require context but model still uses it appropriately: HIGH score
- If context is ambiguous but model handles it reasonably: MODERATE-HIGH score
- If context lacks needed info and model acknowledges this: MODERATE score
- If context lacks info but model fabricates anyway: LOW score
